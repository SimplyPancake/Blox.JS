# Blox.JS
Simple website design in blocks. Basically blocs3, but in JS form and open source!

When my friends ask me to make a website for them, I'm too lazy too program a whole new website when I can just use Blox.
The Idea is simple, a website consists of cubes(blocks) and they are easy to work with.

# Examples
Site examples are: 
[Blox test site where Blox.js is showcased](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SimplyPancake/Blox.JS/blob/master/testSite.html)
[Same site as the Blox.js test site, but recreated without Blox.js](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SimplyPancake/Blox.JS/blob/master/siteWithoutBlox.html)

# How to install?
Link the raw Blox.js and CSS
