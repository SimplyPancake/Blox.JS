# Blox.JS
Simple website design in blocks. Basically blocs3, but in JS form and open source!

When my friends ask me to make a website for them, I'm too lazy too program a whole new website when I can just use Blox.
The Idea is simple, a website consists of cubes(blocks) and the blocks are easy to work with.
